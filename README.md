# Simple Landing Page

## Description 
This project was made independently and without any starter code. It is made with HTML, CSS and JavaScript, following a series of lectures on the theme ‚ÄúJavaScript & the DOM‚Äù.

## General info
The project required me to build a landing page that uses JavaScript to create an interactive navigational.

## Landing Page Behavior

* Navigation is built dynamically as an unordered list - Manipulating the DOM exercise.
* Section Active State - It should be clear which section is being viewed while scrolling through the page.
* Scroll to Anchor - When clicking an item from the navigation menu, the link should scroll to the appropriate section.
* Adding a scroll to top button on the page that‚Äôs only visible when the user scrolls below the fold of the page.

## Code Examples

* `document.createDocumentFragment()` The DocumentFragment interface is a lightweight version of the Document that stores a piece of document structure like a standard document. DocumentFragment isn‚Äôt part of the active DOM tree ,any changes in document fragment, it doesn't affect the document or performance.

* `behavior: 'smooth'` there is a native CSS feature for this: scroll-behavior 
<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/img/smooth.jpg"/>
</p>

_For browsers that do not support the scroll-behavior property, you can use JavaScript or a JavaScript library, like jQuery, to create a solution that will work for all browsers_

`document.querySelector('.hello').scrollIntoView({ behavior: 'smooth' })`

* `performance.now()` - The standard way to measure how long it takes code to run is by using `performance.now()`. It  returns a timestamp that is measured in milliseconds.
