# Simple Landing Page

## Description 
This project was made independently and without any starter code. The project is made with HTML, CSS and JavaScript, following a series of lectures on the theme “JavaScript & the DOM”.

## General info
The project required me to build a landing page that uses JavaScript to create an interactive navigational.

## Landing Page Behavior

* Navigation is built dynamically as an unordered list - Manipulating the DOM exercise.
* Section Active State - It should be clear which section is being viewed while scrolling through the page.
* Scroll to Anchor - When clicking an item from the navigation menu, the link should scroll to the appropriate section.
* Adding a scroll to top button on the page that’s only visible when the user scrolls below the fold of the page.
